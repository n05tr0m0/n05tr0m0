#### Hello everyone!

I'm a Team Lead and Senior Python Developer specializing in AI-powered healthcare backend systems<br>

I design and build integration platforms that connect medical organizations with diagnostic AI vendors, <br>
focusing on reliable data routing, vendor onboarding, and production readiness. <br>
My work combines system architecture (DDD/EDA, microservices), strong engineering practices (CI/CD, observability, testing),  <br>
and hands-on leadership. <br>

My core stack: Python, Apache Kafka, FastAPI, Stream Processing, Docker, PostgreSQL, DICOM, Linux and more.
